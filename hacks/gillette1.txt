Renew your Razor Blades

Find a pair of jeans — any pair, it doesn’t matter if they’re old or new. Make the jean leg straight and flat, either by putting it on a table or your bed.
Now take your razor and “shave” your pants leg. 20 times in one direction, and then another 20 times in the other direction. I promise: It won’t ruin your jeans.With this method, you can use a single blade for up to six months — which means an 8-pack of blades, which usually costs around $20, could potentially last you FOUR YEARS.
