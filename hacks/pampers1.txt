Make fresh Flowers last longer

All you’ll need to do is take an older diaper, place it inside of a large bowl, and fill it with water. Now, fill this one with over 4 cups of liquid. Once the water is fully absorbed by the diaper, you’ll take the diaper and rip it open to expose the water-soaked “hydro gel” that’s inside. Take that gel substance and dump it into the large bowl, add a little bit more water, and mix it up with your hands. Now you’ve got the gel ready to go, just put it inside the next vase and get a cool crystal look in addition!
